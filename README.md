# RAIVEN: Holographic Cognitive Memory System (HCMS)

RAIVEN is a Nix-flaked Python application that implements a Holographic Cognitive Memory System (HCMS). It provides a GraphRAG + RAPTOR architecture for long-term, structured, and abstractive memory for Large Language Models (LLMs), using Neo4j as the graph-vector database and Ollama for embeddings.

## Features

- **GraphRAG + RAPTOR**: Combines graph-based retrieval with recursive abstractive processing for multi-level memory access.
- **Holographic Retrieval**: Simultaneously queries specific details, abstract concepts, and relational facts.
- **Nix Flake**: Reproducible builds and deployments via Nix.
- **Home Manager Service**: Seamless integration with Home Manager for background service management.
- **Secure Configuration**: Uses environment variables and file-based secrets (compatible with `sops-nix`).

## Architecture Overview

The system stores information in three primary node types within Neo4j:

- **`:Chunk`**: Raw segments of conversation text with vector embeddings.
- **`:Entity`**: Specific nouns, concepts, or persons, linked to Chunks.
- **`:Summary`**: Aggregated, higher-level concepts generated by the RAPTOR process, also with embeddings.

## Prerequisites

- [Nix](https://nixos.org/download.html) with flakes enabled.
- [Home Manager](https://nix-community.github.io/home-manager/) (for service deployment).
- Access to a Neo4j 5.x+ instance with vector index support.
- Access to an Ollama instance with an embedding model (e.g., `embeddinggemma:latest`).

## Installation & Usage

### As a Nix Package

To build and run the package directly:

```bash
nix run
```

### As a Home Manager Service

1. Add RAIVEN as an input to your Home Manager flake:

   ```nix
   {
     inputs = {
       # ... other inputs ...
       raiven.url = "path/to/raiven/directory"; # Or a git URL
     };
   }
   ```

2. Import the RAIVEN module in your Home Manager configuration:

   ```nix
   { inputs, pkgs, ... }: {
     imports = [ inputs.raiven.homeManagerModules.default ];

     services.raiven = {
       enable = true;
       package = inputs.raiven.packages.${pkgs.system}.default;

       # Configuration options
       neo4j = {
         uri = "your_neo4j_uri";
         user = "your_neo4j_user";
         passwordFile = "/path/to/neo4j_password_file"; # Optional
         apiKeyFile = "/path/to/neo4j_api_key_file";    # Optional, for API key auth
       };

       ollama = {
         host = "your_ollama_host";
         apiKeyFile = "/path/to/ollama_api_key_file";
         model = "embeddinggemma:latest"; # Or another compatible model
       };

       vectorDimensions = 768; # Must match your embedding model's output
     };
   }
   ```

3. Rebuild and switch your Home Manager configuration:

   ```bash
   home-manager switch
   ```

This will install the RAIVEN package, set up the systemd user service, and start it.

## Configuration

RAIVEN is configured entirely through Home Manager options (as shown above) or environment variables (for non-service use). It no longer uses a `config.json` file.

### Environment Variables (for direct execution)

- `RAIVEN_NEO4J_URI`: Neo4j connection URI (default: `https://server1os1.oneira.pp.ua/neo4j/`).
- `RAIVEN_NEO4J_USER`: Neo4j username (default: `neo4j`).
- `RAIVEN_NEO4J_PASSWORD_FILE`: Path to file containing Neo4j password.
- `RAIVEN_NEO4J_API_KEY_FILE`: Path to file containing Neo4j API key (optional).
- `RAIVEN_OLLAMA_HOST`: Ollama host URI (default: `https://server1os1.oneira.pp.ua/ollama/`).
- `RAIVEN_OLLAMA_API_KEY_FILE`: Path to file containing Ollama API key.
- `RAIVEN_OLLAMA_MODEL`: Ollama model name (default: `embeddinggemma:latest`).
- `RAIVEN_VECTOR_DIMENSIONS`: Vector dimensions (default: `768`).

Secret files are read by the application, and paths can contain `~` which will be expanded.
